GEOFIL model output from study into potential lymphatic filariasis treatment strategies for elimination in American Samoa. Traditional mass drug administration (MDA) was compared to targeted surveillance and treatment strategies. 34 different model configurations were tested and each configuration's output was saved as a csv. Each configuration was run for 26 years (2010-2035) and as the model is stochastic, each configuration was simulated 100 times. 

Columns A-AG contain information on configuration setup, AH-BT contain antigen positive, mf positive, and total population counts for a number of age brackets, BU and BV contain total tested and treated, and BW-GT contain village-level antigen prevalence. Each row corresponds to a simulation year for each simulation. For clarity model output has been divided into a number of directories. 

The "Baseline" directory only contains Baseline.csv, which is the configuration without additional intervention. These simulations only had the standard MDA in 2018, 2019, and 2021.

The "MDA" directory contains all the MDA based output. There are three files, each correspond to a different tested MDA coverage. MDA_High.csv assumed 85% coverage, MDA_REAL.csv assumed 73% coverage, and MDA_WHO.csv assumed 65% coverage. Each MDA file contains results from 1-5 additional years of MDA, each run 100 times. The first 100 simulations are for 1 additional year of MDA, the next 100 simulations are two additional years etc. For clarity, column V contains the number of additional MDA rounds each simulation had. 

The "Household" directory has output from the household-based strategies. It contains two sub-directories: "Single"- configurations where only one member of a household was tested, and "Whole"- configurations where every member of a household was tested. As a number of household-based strategies were tested, the file names contain information on the configuration specifics. The format is "# Teams"_"Treatment Radius"_"Household test aim".csv. For example, three teams with 100m treatment radius and a 50% household test aim is called THREE_100_50.csv. 

The "School" directory has the school-based intervention output. There are three files: SCHOOL_ALL.csv- testing of all students, SCHOOL_ELEM.csv- testing of only elementary aged students, and SCHOOL_TAS.csv- testing of only TAS aged students. 

The "Workplace" directory contains the workplace-based intervention output. There are four files: W_LARGE_NF.csv- testing of large workplaces (50+) and no treatment of families, W_LARGE_WF.csv- testing of large workplaces (50+) and treatment of families, W_SMALL_NF.csv- testing of all workplaces (5+) and no treatment of families, and W_SMALL_WF.csv- testing of all workplaces (5+) and treatment of families.
